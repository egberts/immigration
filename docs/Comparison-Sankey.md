PROs:
==========
sankeymatic - Quickest way to create a chart (https://sankeymatic.com/build/)
sankeymatic - supports Imbalance I/O 
sankeyflow - Easiest Row data entry (all index are labeled, not an integer)
sankey (via matplotlib) - beautiful cyclic graph
HoloViews - Very good hover box
HoloViews - Very good dynamic labeling of links/nodes

CONs:
==========
sankey (via matplotlib) - No hover tipbox info
sankey - no Imbalance I/O (must be precise?)
sankeyflow (via matplotlib) - only acyclic graph (no circular)
HoloViews - only acyclic graph (no circular)
HoloViews - Disjoint X-\>Y-\>V (columnar data entry); difficult to track or insert a single column dataset
sankeymatic - Only acyclic graph
chart-studio - requires Authentication API
sankey (via matplotlib) only does arrow to arrow (no node boxes)
sankeyview - 8y inactive
